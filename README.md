- 👋 Hi, I’m @Kevin Kao
- 👀 I’m interested in understanding things through building applications, scripts, and analysis, proving or disproving my understanding of the world. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning the microstructure of financial exchanges, machine learning and predictive modeling/regression, and application development. 
- 💞️ I’m currently looking to collaborate on nothing and focus on getting my feet wet. Feel free to reach out if you'd like to share ideas or work on things together, I'm always open to trying new things as long as they're exciting/ 
- 📫 How to reach me: kevinkaodevelops@gmail.com
